  `qiskit-ibm-experiment` is a Python API for accessing the IBM experiment database,
  used as part of `qiskit-experiments` for recording the results of performed
  experiments.

  This new package is built upon the work already done in `qiskit-ibmq-provider`
  package and replaces it going forward as the whole package is being deprecated.

  `qiskit-ibm-experiment` is not included as part of `Qiskit` meta package and thereby you have to
   install it separately using ``pip install qiskit-ibm-experiment``.
